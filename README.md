# Qb

Qb is a 2D platformer created by Brick Dalsis. Play through 20 fun and challenging levels to complete the game. Developed in GameMakerStudio. Music also created by Brick Dalsis. 


## Code
### Rooms
- Each level is contained within a room
- Deaths and the timer are persistent through the room through the game controller object, so when testing rooms, a game controller object needs to be added to the room (delete once implemented into full game)
